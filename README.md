# Learn-Typing

So recently I discovered that VScode was making my laptop slow. so I decided to learn to use vim instead. Then I noticed something odd while I was praticing the vimtutor. That whenever I hit the number row, I was looking down on my keyboard. I knew if I was going to master vim, I needed to brush up my typing. Additionally, I had accidentally found AlpineJs. I was really carried away by how simple it seems. Though I couldn't figure out which project to use it for. So this project is a way for me to fiddle around with AlpineJS and also increase my typing accuracy and speed.

I have added the sound feedback on error key press as a kind of reinforcement learning. ***Got the idea for a book named "Don't Shoot the Dog! by Karen Pryor***
